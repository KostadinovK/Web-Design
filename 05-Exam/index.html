            <p>Two spacious floors of a former Victorian warehouse on Leonard Street have been kitted out for daytime eating, drinking, thinking & meeting.  The interior blends the raw, pared-down character of the factory building with layers of bespoke furniture, mosaics and graphic lighting features, as well as the constantly evolving exhibitions that adorn the walls. Its open, airy, drowning in natural light and the perfect environment for meetings, lunches, an afternoon cocktail or a quick game of ping pong!</p>
